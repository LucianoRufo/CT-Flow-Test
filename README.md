## CT-Flow

A personal CLI tool similar to git flow that was born from the needs of a team of the best devs in Uruguay.

We are currently working hard on making better development processes for a continuous integration environment.
As a team our objective is to be more involved in the flow of our work and at the same time delivering value having the least amount of problems during the process.

For this fact we decided to put our own flow on paper.

This image is a first version of our baby.

## Installing Instructions

1. npm i.
2. npm install -g . (on project root).
3. ctflow --help for basic commands.
4. ctflow life forever.

## Features

- Handling tasks directly from any agile management tool and referencing them over the flow of work.
- Handling of abstract epic branches just as a concept of grouping features that are an MVP.
- Handling of pepito branches, which represent our minimum unit of work tasks, both in or out of an epic.
- Handling of hotfixes and releases as we commonly know but destined to be a cherry-picking process in which we as developers are more involved with the task.

## Future releases

1. Cleanup console colors, after certain commands the color stays on the console.
2. Good documentation.
3. Init to setup your own project prefix and not CTDEV-.
4. Cool menues to make the cherry picks more friendly.
5. Implement commitizen like commit automation.
